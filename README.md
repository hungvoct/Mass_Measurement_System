# Mass Measurement System

A complete workflow for weighing objects using an STM32F4 microcontroller and a precision load cell, with real-time display on a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **High-precision measurement**  
  Uses a calibrated load cell and HX711 amplifier for accurate weight readings.
- **STM32F4-based controller**  
  Leverages the power and peripherals of the STM32F407VG to sample and process sensor data.  
- **Customizable user interface**  
  Real-time graphical display on an PC GUI showing weight updates and tare.
